**Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?**
The Client was the company of DriverPass. They wished to create a system that allowed customers to practice the written exams and also schedule practical tests for driving practice. The Users would also be able to set up the driving exams as well. They wanted us to be able to allow the IT admin to change the access users had.

**What Did you Do Particularly Well?**
I believe I made good diagrams. They are easy to read and interpret and contain the information needed to proceed to the next step of the project.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**
I would redo the business documentation portion. I believe I could have gone more in depth than I had to better explain what was needed for the project. I would also use information that I have now to better fill out the first section of the business requirements.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**
I kept in mind the requests they had regarding what the users needed and what they wanted the customers to be able to do with their profiles. The user's needs are integral when designing a piece of software, if one tries to make software without keeping the considerations of the user then the design will be useless to the user and that can ruin the relation between the software developer and the client.

**How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**
I approach designing software by going through a step by step process of what the designer wants for the user to do and moving on from there. In the future I will try to create design coduments like used in this class to structure the creation of systems.
